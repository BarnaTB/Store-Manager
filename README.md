# Store-Manager
This is a web application that helps store owners manage sales and product inventory records. This application is meant for use in a single store.

## Getting Started

You can clone the project using the link [Github repository](https://github.com/BarnaTB/Store-Manager.git) and checkout the current output from [github pages](https://barnatb.github.io/Store-Manager/)

## Prerequisites

The pages do not need much to be viewed as any web browser can view them from [this site](https://barnatb.github.io/Store-Manager/) as long as they have internet access.

## Installing

* Clone the project into your local repository using this command:

    `git clone https://github.com/BarnaTB/StackOverflow-lite.git`

* Switch to the gh-pages branch as it has the current production ready code.

    `git checkout gh-pages`

## Running the tests

There are currently no automated tests for this project.

## Deployment

The pages are live on [github pages](https://barnatb.github.io/Store-Manager/). They, however, have only been tested with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox so __no__ assurance of perfomance in any other browser can be given.

  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Javascript
  * Python/Flask(APIs)
